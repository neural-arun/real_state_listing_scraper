## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisite: Virtual Environment
This project uses a shared virtual environment in the root folder. If you haven't created it yet:
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install playwright pandas beautifulsoup4 playwright-stealth httpx[http2]
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Choose Your Scraper
Each scraper is designed for a different need:

*   **[Semantic Browser Scraper](./semantic_browser_scraper):** 
    Fast and free. Reads property cards directly from search results using text matching. Best for quick scans.
*   **[Deep Browser Scraper](./deep_browser_scraper):** 
    The most accurate free method. It visits every individual listing page to extract hidden details. Use this if you want the highest quality data for free.
*   **[Parallel HTTP Scraper](./parallel_http_scraperapi):** 
    Professional scale. No browser needed. It uses ScraperAPI to bypass Cloudflare and fetches 5+ pages in parallel. Best for large-scale data collection.

### 3. Running a Scraper
Navigate to any of the three folders and follow the instructions in its specific `README.md`. 
Example:
```powershell
cd semantic_browser_scraper
..\venv\Scripts\activate
python scraper.py
```

## 📊 Data Output
All results are exported as CSV files. Each scraper is pre-configured to output data with these columns:
- **City**: Target city name
- **Price**: Listing price (e.g., ₹2.5 Cr)
- **Location**: Full address or locality
- **Size (sqft)**: Area in sqft or yards
- **Contact Info**: Agent/Builder/Owner details
- **URL**: Link to the property (v2 and v3 only)
